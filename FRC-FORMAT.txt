FORMATTING OF JAVACSV FILE 
===========================
The format of the CSV file that is written to the CRio must be compatable with
the JavaCSVReader format (see README.txt). However, because of a need for a
unified format in order to be able to parse the file and create FRC based
objects. 

The formatting of the CRio-CSV file is an abstraction of the JavaCSVReader
format. It follows all rules and such, however there is a small extension of
these rules. 

All devices MUST be in the same header. The first column MUST be the name of the
device,and the second column MUST be the type of device, all other columns
represent the arguments to the constructors of the devices respectively. For
example below would be a layout of the drive motors for a 4 motor drive. 

...

#Devices#
#Name,Type,arg1,arg2,arg3
;FrontLeftDrive,Jaguar,1,1,1
;FrontRightDrive,Jaguar,1,1,2
;BackLeftDrive,Jaguar,1,1,3
;BackRightDrive,Jaguar,1,1,4

...

Because of the uncertainty of future devices and their constructors, the default
parser creates ONLY the below devices:

Jaguar
Vector
Servo
Relay
Compressor
Solenoid
Accelerometer
Encoder
Gyro

NOTE: you are not limited to these devices only. This simply means that parsers
are written for these devices only. You can create your own parsers and add them 
to the list of parsers. See the javadoc for the RobotConfig class for more
details.
